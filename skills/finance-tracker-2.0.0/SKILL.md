**Amount formats:**

- `$50` — USD, auto-converts to your currency
- `€100` — EUR
- `100 USD` — explicit currency

**Examples:**
```bash
finance add 50000 "lunch"
finance add 50k "groceries"
finance add $25 "Netflix subscription"
```

### Undo & Edit

```bash
# Remove last transaction
finance undo

# Edit a transaction
finance edit <id> --amount=60000
finance edit <id> --desc="dinner with friends"
finance edit <id> --category=food

# Delete specific transaction
finance delete <id>
```

### View & Search

```bash
finance report [period]    # today, week, month, year, all
finance recent [n]         # last n transactions
finance search "food"      # search by keyword
```

### Report Periods

除了基本的 `today`, `week`, `month`, `year`, `all`，還支援：

```bash
# 昨天
finance report yesterday

# 上週（週一到週日）
finance report last-week

# 上個月
finance report last-month

# 上上個月

## 🔄 Recurring Expenses

Track subscriptions and bills that repeat automatically.

### Add Recurring

```bash
finance recurring add <amount> "<description>" <frequency> [--day=N]
```

**Frequencies:** daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly

**Examples:**
```bash
finance recurring add 110k "mobile provider" monthly --day=1
finance recurring add 50k "Netflix" monthly
finance recurring add 200k "gym membership" monthly --day=15
```

### Manage Recurring

```bash
finance recurring              # List all
finance recurring list         # Same as above
finance recurring due          # Show what's due today
finance recurring process      # Auto-log all due expenses
finance recurring remove <id>  # Deactivate
```

### How It Works

- Recurring expenses track their next due date
- Run `finance recurring process` daily (or in heartbeat) to auto-log
- Each logged expense appears in your regular transactions
- Monthly totals shown in the recurring report

## 🎯 Savings Goals

Set targets and track progress towards financial goals.

### Add Goals

```bash

finance goal add "Emergency Fund" 10000000
finance goal add "Vacation" 3000000 --by=2026-08-01 --current=500000
```

## Tips

1. **Use 'k' for thousands** — `50k` is faster than `50000`
2. **Currency prefix** — `$50` auto-converts
3. **Daily recurring check** — run `finance recurring process` in heartbeat
4. **Weekly insights** — run `finance digest` for summaries
5. **Goal tracking** — update goals when you save money
6. **Budget alerts** — run `finance budget 100k` to stay on track
